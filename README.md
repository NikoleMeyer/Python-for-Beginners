# Python-for-Beginners
Some basic practice programs for those new to Python (including myself!) utilizing functions, parameters, variables, and loops. 

# Create a program that calculates the area of a circle.

pi = 3.14
def measureCircleArea(radius):
	print (pi * radius ** 2)
measureCircleArea()

# Create a program that calculates the average of a series of integers. 

def computeAverage():
    print (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 / 4)
computeAverage()

# Create a program that converts KM into Miles.

KmInMiles = .062
def kilometersToMiles(km):
    print (km * KmInMiles)
kilometersToMiles()

# Print the first five odd integers using the 'for' loop.

def firstFiveOddNumbers():
    for i in range (1,10,2):
        print (i)
firstFiveOddNumbers()
